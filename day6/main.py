
#Day 6 — Reeborg’s Hurdle (Functions & Decomposition)

# ✅ PROJECT: Reeborg’s Hurdle (or local pseudo-robot)
# 1) Define small helper functions: turn_left(), turn_right(), jump()
# 2) In jump(): move up the wall, over, and down (sequence of moves/turns)
# 3) Use a loop to repeat hurdles until the goal (while not at_goal(): jump())
# 4) Extract repeated patterns into functions to keep code DRY
# 5) (Variable hurdles) Detect walls ahead -> if wall_in_front(): jump() else: move()
# 6) (Edge) Ensure you don’t run into infinite loops; stop when at_goal()
# 7) (Polish) Add comments describing each function’s responsibility
# NOTE: If you’re not in Reeborg, pseudo-code the same logic in Python for practice.
