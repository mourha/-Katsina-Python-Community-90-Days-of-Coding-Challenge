#Day 3 — Treasure Island (Text Adventure)

# ✅ PROJECT: Treasure Island
# 1) Print a short intro/story and simple ASCII map
# 2) First decision: input("Left or Right? ").lower().strip()
# 3) Branch outcomes with if/elif/else; show 'game over' for wrong path
# 4) Second decision on the correct branch: "Swim or Wait?"
# 5) Third decision: choose a door color; only one leads to treasure
# 6) Ensure user inputs are case-insensitive and validated
# 7) Keep messages short and descriptive; reveal outcomes per branch
# 8) (Polish) Ask to replay (loop until 'n'); clear screen between runs (optional)
