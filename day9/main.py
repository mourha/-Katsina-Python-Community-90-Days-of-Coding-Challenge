#Day 9 — Secret Auction (Dictionaries & Loops)

# ✅ PROJECT: Secret Auction
# 1) Initialize an empty dict: bids = {}
# 2) Loop: ask for bidder name and bid amount; validate bid is a positive number
# 3) Store in dict: bids[name] = bid
# 4) Ask if there are more bidders ('yes' to continue, 'no' to finish)
# 5) After loop, find the max bid and corresponding winner
# 6) Print: "The winner is {name} with a bid of ${amount:.2f}"
# 7) (Edge) Handle ties (either first-come wins or detect and announce tie)
# 8) (Polish) Format currency; clear screen between bidders if your environment allows
