# ✅ PROJECT: Calculator
# 1) Define arithmetic functions: add(a,b), subtract(a,b), multiply(a,b), divide(a,b)
# 2) Create a dict mapping symbols to functions: {"+": add, "-": subtract, "*": multiply, "/": divide}
# 3) Ask user for first number; then show available operations; ask for operator; ask for next number
# 4) Validate numeric inputs and operator choice; re-prompt if invalid
# 5) Compute result = operations[op](a, b); print the equation and result
# 6) Ask: continue calculating with the current result? ('y' to chain, 'n' to start new, 'q' to quit)
# 7) Loop until the user quits; on divide, guard against division by zero
# 8) (Polish) Round to reasonable decimals; allow multiple chained operations cleanly
