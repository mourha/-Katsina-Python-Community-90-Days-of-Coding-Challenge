# ✅ PROJECT: Tip Calculator

# 1) Ask for total bill (float), tip percentage (int), and number of people (int)
# 2) Convert and validate inputs; re-prompt on invalid values (try/except ValueError)
# 3) Compute tip = bill * (tip_percent / 100)
# 4) Compute total = bill + tip
# 5) Compute per_person = total / people
# 6) Round to 2 decimal places using round(value, 2) or formatted strings "{:.2f}"
# 7) Print a clear breakdown: bill, tip %, tip amount, total, per-person
# 8) (Edge) Guard against division by zero (people >= 1)
# 9) (Polish) Support entering tip as "10" or "10%"
